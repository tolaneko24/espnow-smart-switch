# ESP-NOW Smart Switch
Real-time Wireless Smart Switch Network using ESP-NOW on ESP32/ESP8266

---

## Overview

This project implements a real-time wireless control network based on the ESP-NOW protocol using ESP32/ESP8266 microcontrollers.

The system is designed for smart switch and embedded IoT applications where:
- low latency,
- lightweight communication,
- low cost,
- and decentralized wireless control

are required.

Unlike traditional WiFi smart switches that depend heavily on cloud communication, this system allows direct peer-to-peer communication between nodes through ESP-NOW while still supporting optional cloud connectivity through Blynk.

The architecture is inspired by commercial smart home systems such as:
- Zigbee Smart Switch
- Aqara
- Philips Hue
- Tuya Smart Switch

but implemented using ESP32/ESP8266 hardware and ESP-NOW protocol.

---

## Objectives

- Build a real-time wireless control network.
- Reduce latency compared to cloud-only systems.
- Support multiple relay nodes.
- Implement ACK and retransmission mechanisms.
- Evaluate communication quality and reliability.
- Study the feasibility of ESP-NOW for smart home applications.
